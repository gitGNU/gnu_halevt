Todo list
---------

* (Marcin Gryszkalis) It would be really great if I could use regexp 
  (PCRE based I think) in conditionals/matches, like

<halevt:Device match="
        hal.volume.is_disc = true &amp;
        hal.volume.disk.type ~ /^cd/

Looks like a very good idea to me. The issue I see is that it could
complicate the match parsing, since currently it is a 2 phase parsing,
first the characters &|()! that delimits boolean expressions are used to
delimitate the strings, and then the strings are parsed. if &|()! can appear
within regular expressions, it means that some parsing of the strings is
needed during boolean expressions delimitation. Also using / as a regexp
delimiter means that it has to be possible to escape it.

even without regexp lack of explicit string delimiters is a problem, like - I
hard to match on hal.info.product because it contains spaces

* (felix) system configuration files are read after the user's, overwriting 
the user's settings. Also it is confusing not to have all the files read.

The problem is that the configurations are merely added and never replaced.

* maybe it would make sense to have a way to get the Condition value 
  expanded in the exec, or example as $hal.condition_value$.
  Also instead of a simple value, it could be a match.

* (Григорий Фучеджи, gry) speaking about value in Property Action 
I think it would be useful to add some conditions handling like in match 
attribute for halevt:Device tag. Maybe halevt:Action tag should have 
value or match attribute which will contain condition.
