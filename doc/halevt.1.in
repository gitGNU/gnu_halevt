.TH HALEVT 1
.SH NAME
halevt \- Generic handler for HAL events
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B halevt [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Halevt
is a daemon that executes arbitrary commands when a device with certain 
properties is added to the system and when
device properties change, using HAL.
Unless a configuration file is given on the command
line with the \fI\-c\fP option, configuration files are searched for in 
$HOME/.halevt, @sysconfdir@/@PACKAGE_NAME@, and @datadir@/@PACKAGE_NAME@ 
(in that order). All the files ending with .xml found in these directories 
are considered to be configuration files. If a file with the same name 
has already been found in a previous directory, it is ignored. Default for
halevt is to run as a daemon in the background.
.PP
.I Halevt
may also be run in another mode, called the reporting mode, turned on by 
the \fI\-i\fP option. In that case no config file is read, 
.I Halevt
stays in the foreground and report all the HAL events.
