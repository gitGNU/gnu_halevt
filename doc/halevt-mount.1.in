.SH DESCRIPTION
.I halevt-mount
Mount or umount device through HAL and keep a track of devices handled.
When called as 
.B halevt-umount
the default is to unmount, when called as 
.B halevt-mount
the default is to mount.
Option \fI-c\fP, \fI-l\fP, \fI-r\fP, \fI-s\fP or \fI-w\fP changes the 
operation performed.
Additional argument is considered to be a mount point, a device or an udi
when unmounting or removing.
.PP
If the commands are not called with \fI-s\fP after changes in the state of the
devices (after mounting, unmounting, removing devices), the information
available for

may become out of sync with the state of the system.

otherwise this option is passed, if the filesystem allows it.
